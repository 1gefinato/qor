In this article, we will explain what POCALOID2 is, how it differs from VOCALOID2, and how you can download it for free.
 
## What is POCALOID2?
 
POCALOID2 is a modified version of VOCALOID2 that was created by a group of hackers called TEAM peace-out. According to their website[^2^], POCALOID2 was made to address some of the limitations and flaws of VOCALOID2, such as:
 
- The high price of VOCALOID2 voicebanks and editors
- The lack of compatibility between VOCALOID2 and newer Windows operating systems
- The difficulty of installing and activating VOCALOID2 products
- The limited functionality and customization of VOCALOID2 editors

POCALOID2 offers a solution to these problems by providing a free and easy way to download and use all the voices of VOCALOID2, as well as some additional features such as:

- A standalone and VSTi version of the POCALOID2 editor that can run on any Windows OS
- A manager system that allows you to initialize and update the voice database map
- A singer editor that allows you to adjust the parameters and settings of each voicebank
- A library system that allows you to install and uninstall voicebanks easily

## How does POCALOID2 differ from VOCALOID2?
 
POCALOID2 is not an official product of Yamaha or any of the VOCALOID2 voice providers. It is a hacked and modified version of VOCALOID2 that uses the same synthesis engine but with different files and interfaces. Therefore, POCALOID2 has some advantages and disadvantages compared to VOCALOID2.
 
Some of the advantages of POCALOID2 are:

- It is free and easy to download and use
- It can run on any Windows OS without compatibility issues
- It has more features and options for editing and customizing the voices
- It has all the voices of VOCALOID2 available in one package

Some of the disadvantages of POCALOID2 are:

- It is illegal and violates the terms and conditions of VOCALOID2 products
- It may contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer or data
- It may not work properly or crash unexpectedly
- It may not support newer versions of VOCALOID or other vocal synthesis software
- It may not have the same quality or authenticity as the original voices

## How to download POCALOID2?
 
If you want to try POCALOID2 at your own risk, you will need to download three components: the manager, the system, and at least one voicebank. You can find these files on various websites or forums, such as VOCAKEY[^2^] or Archive.org[^1^]. However, be careful when downloading from unknown sources, as they may contain harmful or malicious content.
 
Once you have downloaded the files, you will need to install them in order: first the manager, then the system, then the voicebanks. Then, you will need to run the manager and click on "initialize voice database map" and "run POCALOID2 singer editor". After closing the singer editor, you can run the POCALOID2 editor again and start using it.
 
If you want to install or uninstall more voicebanks, you will need to repeat this process every time. You can also use the library system to manage your voicebanks more
